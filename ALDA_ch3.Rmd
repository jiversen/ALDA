# Chapter 3

The data are not publicly available, so it's not possible to recreate the chapter.
Instead, results taken from idre website, and code shown for illustration.

```{r load data}
early.int <- read.table("d:/earlyint_pp.txt", header=T, sep=",")
early.int <- early.int %>% mutate(id = factor(id))
attach(early.int)
```

## Empirical Change Plots

```{r plot}
subset <- early.int[c(1:12, 175:186)]
subset

with(subset,
     xyplot( cog ~ age | id, data = subset, as.table=T,ylim=c(50,150),type=c("p","r"))
)

As in Chapter 2, you can examine the empirical distribution across individuals
of OLS intercept, slopes and $\sigma^2$. They note this inflates the apparent between-individual variability
since they are merely (fallible) estimates of 'true' change estimated from (noisy) observations. 
The size and distribution of $\sigma^2$ also gives some idea of how good the model is.

## Mixed effect model fitting

Statistical models describe hypothesized _population_ processes, not observed sample behavior.

### Formulation

#### Level 1

The outcome $Y_{ij}$ for each individual $i$ and measurement occasion $j$

$$
Y_{ij} = 
\underbrace{
\pi_{0i} + \pi_{1i} * TIME_{ij}
}_{structural~('true')}
+ 
\underbrace{
\epsilon_{ij}
}_{stochastic}
$$
A key concept is that the 'structural' part of the model represents an individual's *true* change trajectory, 
while the 'stochastic' part of the model, $\epsilon$, captures the *measurement error* in the actual observations _plus_
any part of the outcome not predicted by TIME (e.g. their $AGE$). 

Note that TIME is typically a 'centered' version of $AGE$ so that the intercept
can have a meaningful interpretation (e.g. using $TIME = AGE - AGE_{0}$ so that the intercept will be the 
true value of $Y$ at $AGE_{0}$, the 'initial status,' instead of the less-interpretable true value at $AGE = 0$).
In my analyses, typically also include baseline $AGE_0$ as well as $\Delta AGE$.

The $\pi$ are the *true* intercept and slope (the 'individual growth parameters') and 
$\epsilon_{ij}$ (the 'level-1 residuals') is the deviation of each observation from the 
true linear trend defined by subject-specific $\pi$ and is unmeasured and so
assumed to be *random error* and (for OLS) follow the distribution:


$$\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma_\epsilon^2)$$
This implies what they call 'classical' assumptions: IID and homoscedastic variance across timepoints and individuals.
However, they point out that in longitudinal data, any 'unexplained person-specific time-invariant' 
effect will create correlation of residuals across timepoints (within an individual). It's also possible that
the measurement precision will vary across timepoints, leading to residual variance being time-dependent
(aka heteroscedastic).

Promisingly, they say that the multi-level model 'accomodates automatically for certain kinds of complex error structure'
and that this will be discussed in Chapter 4 and 8.

Questions: 

* What if the $\epsilon$ are not distributed normally? Presumably that is evidence that the model
is under-specified, but what else can be learned? OTOH, one could make $\sigma_\epsilon^2$ zero by overfitting.
How is that balance struck? 
* What to do in the case that different individuals have different numbers of time points 
and different starting ages? Then $AGE_{0}$ would be different for each individual...


#### Level 2

This is a model for 'systematic inter-individual differences in change' that models differences
between individual change trajectories and (time-invariant) characteristics of the individual.
The outcomes are the individual growth parameters and are modeled with a true population intercept/slope, 
a true effect due to condition,
and a subject-specific stochastic deviation of each individual's growth parameters $\zeta$.

They put forward the image that each individual draws their growth parameters from an unknown 
random, bivariate population distribution.


$$\pi_{0i} = \gamma_{00} + \gamma_{01} * CONDITION_i + \zeta_{0i}
\\
\pi_{1i} = \gamma_{10} + \gamma_{11} * CONDITION_i + \zeta_{1i}$$

The $\zeta$ are jointly distributed as:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
\zeta_{0i} \\ \zeta_{1i}
\end{bmatrix}
\sim \mathcal{N}
\left(
\begin{bmatrix}
  0 \\ 0
\end{bmatrix},
\begin{bmatrix}
  \sigma_{0}^2 & \sigma_{01} \\ \sigma_{10} & \sigma_{1}^2
\end{bmatrix}
\right)$$

##### Fixed Effects ($\gamma$)
Describe systematic inter-individual differences in trajectories 
according to $CONDITION$ predictor variable(s)

Say $CONDITION$ is whether or not an individual received an intervention. 

- $\gamma_{•0}$ describe the average
hypothesized true trajectory of individuals not receiving the intervention. 
- $\gamma_{•1}$ capture the effect of 
the intervention, namely the hypothesized effect of the intervention on the growth model. 

*Question Answered*: "Does the intervention have an effect on individual growth?"
If these are non-zero, we can conclude the intervention had an effect on the growth.

##### Random Effects ($\zeta$):
Allows each individual's growth parameters $\pi$ to be scattered around the population means $\gamma$.

$\zeta$ is the portion of individual growth parameters $\pi$ not explained by level-2 predictors. 
It's descirbed by a bivariate normal distribution defined by a variance-covariance matrix.

$\sigma_{0~\lor~1}^2$ is the population variance in true individual parameters (intercept $\lor$ slope)
around the population averages $\gamma$. Called _conditional residual variances_ since describe portion of
variance left over after accounting for the model's predictor(s).

*Question Answered*: "How much heterogeneity in true change remains after accounting for the model's predictor(s)?"

$\sigma_{01}$ is the population covariance of individual intercept and slope.
Allowing for correlation of level-2 residuals allows for individual initial status (intercept) 
and rate of change (slope) to be correlated.

*Question Answered*: "Controlling for condition [e.g. intervention], 
are true initial status and true rate of change related?"
