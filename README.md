# ALDA
My notes and R code for Singer &amp; Willett's "Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis"

Spring 2021

The code to replicate analyses in ALDA takes as a starting point UCLA's Institute for Digital Research & Education Statistical Consulting's excellent
[data and code resources](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/examples/alda/). Thanks to them.
